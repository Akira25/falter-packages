# Falter-Fix-LuCI-Buttons

This package is supposed to be used only for Falter-firmwares based on OpenWrt
19.07.x. It fixes missing buttons on LuCi startup page by applying the
workaround mentioned [here](https://github.com/Freifunk-Spalter/packages/issues/28#issuecomment-688809505).
This is realised via a uci-default sctipt.
